This section is intended for system administrators who need to deploy Department of Defense (DoD) certificates across multiple devices or manage certificates in an organizational environment. These certificates are necessary to ensure secure access to DoD resources for all users.

You will find two approaches for installing DoD certificates:

- **Manual Method:**  
  Provides step-by-step instructions for manually downloading and installing certificates. This is useful for targeted deployments or when customizing the installation process.

- **Script Method:**  
  Offers a script to automate the installation of DoD certificates across systems. This is ideal for bulk deployments or when consistency and efficiency are required.

> **Note:**  
> Anytime you run any scripts, it is recommended to review the code beforehand to verify it is not doing anything outside the described steps.

Both methods achieve the same resultâ€”installing the necessary DoD certificatesâ€”but differ in terms of scalability and automation.
