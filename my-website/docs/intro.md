# Guide Introduction

This website offers scripts, guides, tools, and helpful links to assist you in setting up CACs, YubiKeys, or IC/ICC Cards for secure authentication on your devices. Whether you're working from a personal or professional device, you'll find resources tailored for both system administrators and end-users.

This guide focuses primarily on **macOS**, with some content applicable to Linux or Windows where noted.

## What are CACs, YubiKeys, IC/ICC Cards and Smart Cards?

**Smart Cards** is a general term for physical cards with embedded integrated circuits (chips) that can process data. On macOS, Apple refers to CACs, PIV cards, and similar devices (including YubiKeys in smart card mode) as "Smart Cards." These cards are used for secure authentication to computers, web resources, and applications, often providing two-factor authentication and cryptographic security.

A **Common Access Card (CAC)** is a smart card issued primarily by the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies. It is used for secure identification and authentication, enabling access to government computers, networks, and physical facilities. CACs contain embedded microchips that store certificates and cryptographic keys for secure login and digital signatures.

A **YubiKey** is a hardware authentication device produced by Yubico. It supports multiple authentication protocols (such as FIDO2, U2F, PIV, and OTP) and can be used as a smart card for secure login, two-factor authentication, and cryptographic operations. Some government agencies allow YubiKeys to be used in place of traditional CACs or PIV cards for secure access.

**IC Cards** (Integrated Circuit Cards), also known as ICC Cards, are a broad category of smart cards used across many sectors‚Äîincluding government, banking, healthcare, and corporate environments. These cards store identity credentials, digital certificates, or cryptographic keys, enabling secure login, encryption, and access control.

Unlike CACs and YubiKeys, IC/ICC cards may not follow the DoD's strict standards but still conform to international protocols such as ISO/IEC 7816 or GlobalPlatform. They are widely used in enterprise badge systems, citizen ID cards, EMV banking cards, and secure building access.

> _Fun fact: All CACs are IC cards, but not all IC cards are CACs. IC/ICC is the broader technical classification._

## Who is this for?

This site is for government employees, contractors, IT administrators, and anyone who uses a CAC, Smart Card, YubiKey, or IC/ICC Card to securely access systems on macOS. If you're trying to get things working‚Äîor just make them work better‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the right place.
