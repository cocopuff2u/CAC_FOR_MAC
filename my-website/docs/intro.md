# Guide Introduction

This website offers scripts, guides, tools, and helpful links to assist you in setting up CACs, YubiKeys, or IC/ICC Cards for secure authentication on your devices. Whether you're working from a personal or professional device, you'll find resources tailored for both system administrators and end-users.

It is also a place for users to share their own experiences, tips, and solutionsâ€”helping give information back to the community and improve the guide for everyone.

This guide focuses primarily on **macOS**, with some content applicable to Linux or Windows where noted.

## Who is this for?

This site is for government employees, contractors, IT administrators, and anyone who uses a CAC, Smart Card, YubiKey, or IC/ICC Card to securely access systems on macOS. If you're trying to get things workingâ€”or just make them work betterâ€”youâ€™re in the right place.

## What are CACs, YubiKeys, IC/ICC Cards and Smart Cards?

**Smart Cards** is a general term for physical cards with embedded integrated circuits (chips) that can process data. On macOS, Apple refers to CACs, PIV cards, and similar devices (including YubiKeys in smart card mode) as "Smart Cards." These cards are used for secure authentication to computers, web resources, and applications, often providing two-factor authentication and cryptographic security.

A **Common Access Card (CAC)** is a smart card issued primarily by the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies. It is used for secure identification and authentication, enabling access to government computers, networks, and physical facilities. CACs contain embedded microchips that store certificates and cryptographic keys for secure login and digital signatures.

A **YubiKey** is a hardware authentication device produced by Yubico. It supports multiple authentication protocols (such as FIDO2, U2F, PIV, and OTP) and can be used as a smart card for secure login, two-factor authentication, and cryptographic operations. Some government agencies allow YubiKeys to be used in place of traditional CACs or PIV cards for secure access.

**IC Cards** (Integrated Circuit Cards), also known as ICC Cards, are a broad category of smart cards used across many sectorsâ€”including government, banking, healthcare, and corporate environments. These cards store identity credentials, digital certificates, or cryptographic keys, enabling secure login, encryption, and access control.

Unlike CACs and YubiKeys, IC/ICC cards may not follow the DoD's strict standards but still conform to international protocols such as ISO/IEC 7816 or GlobalPlatform. They are widely used in enterprise badge systems, citizen ID cards, EMV banking cards, and secure building access.

:::note[Fun Fact]
 _All CACs are IC cards, but not all IC cards are CACs. IC/ICC is the broader technical classification._

## What are Certificates?

Certificates are digital documents used to prove identity and establish trust between devices, users, and services. They use cryptographic keys to enable secure communication and authentication. Certificates are a core part of how smart cards, IC Cards, CACs, and YubiKeys work for secure login and access.

There are several types of certificates involved in authentication:

- **Root CA Certificate**: The top-level certificate in a trust chain, issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by your device or organization. Root CAs can be public (pre-installed on your device) or private (installed by your organization for internal use).

  <img src="/img/CertLargeRoot.webp" alt="Example Root" width="80" /><br/>

- **Intermediate CA Certificate**: Issued by a root CA (or another intermediate CA), these certificates act as a "middle layer" in the trust chain. Intermediate certificates are used to sign user or device certificates, providing an extra layer of security and flexibility. Most certificate chains include one or more intermediate certificates between the root and the end-user certificate.
  <img src="/img/CertLargeStd.webp" alt="Example Intermediate" width="80" /><br/>

- **Public CA Certificate**: Issued by widely trusted third-party organizations (such as DigiCert, GlobalSign, etc.), these certificates are used to secure public websites and services. Devices and browsers trust these by default.
  <img src="/img/CertLargeRoot.webp" alt="Example Public" width="80" />   <img src="/img/CertLargeStd.webp" alt="Example Intermediate" width="80" /><br/>

- **User Certificate**: Issued to an individual user and stored on a smart card or security key. This certificate proves your identity when logging in or accessing secure resources. The private key for this certificate never leaves your smart card or device.  
  User certificates are typically issued by an intermediate CA, but in some cases, they can be issued directly by a root CA (especially in smaller or legacy environments).

These certificates work together in a chain of trust, allowing your device to verify that a certificate presented by a smart card or website is valid and trusted.
