# Guide Introduction

**This website is designed to provide scripts, guides, links, and tools to help you get your CAC, Smart Card, or YubiKey working for authentication on your devices.**

## What are CACs, YubiKeys, and Smart Cards?

A **Common Access Card (CAC)** is a smart card issued primarily by the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies. It is used for secure identification and authentication, enabling access to government computers, networks, and physical facilities. CACs contain embedded microchips that store certificates and cryptographic keys for secure login and digital signatures.

A **YubiKey** is a hardware authentication device produced by Yubico. It supports multiple authentication protocols (such as FIDO2, U2F, PIV, and OTP) and can be used as a smart card for secure login, two-factor authentication, and cryptographic operations. Some government agencies allow YubiKeys to be used in place of traditional CACs or PIV cards for secure access.

**Smart Cards** is a general term for physical cards with embedded integrated circuits (chips) that can process data. On macOS, Apple refers to CACs, PIV cards, and similar devices (including YubiKeys in smart card mode) as "Smart Cards." These cards are used for secure authentication to computers, web resources, and applications, often providing two-factor authentication and cryptographic security.
