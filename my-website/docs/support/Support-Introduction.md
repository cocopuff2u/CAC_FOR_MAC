# Welcome to the CAC for Mac Project

A core part of our mission—and the original intent of this project—is to provide a central location for all smart card and certificate questions for the Mac community. Information was previously scattered across many old Mac admin posts, open-source projects, URLs, and outdated guides. By consolidating knowledge, tools, and resources into an easy-to-read and user-friendly format, we give Mac admins/users a single place to find collected, up-to-date information.

## **About the Project**

Everything in this project is sourced from open-source projects, applications, and shared knowledge articles. Built by the community for the community, much of the progress in bringing smart cards to Macs comes directly from the collective efforts, experiences, and solutions contributed by Mac admins and users. Our community has played a vital role in developing, refining, and sharing the workflows that make smart card integration on macOS possible.

## **Our Goals**

- **Centralized Knowledge:**  
  Serve as a single, reliable source for the latest information related to smart cards and certificates on macOS.

- **Community Collaboration:**  
  Foster a welcoming space where Mac admins can contribute, share, and improve resources for the benefit of all.

- **Ease of Use:**  
  Break down complex topics and technical details, making them accessible to users of all experience levels.

- **Up-to-Date Information:**  
  Ensure the community always has access to the most current tools, techniques, and best practices.

- **Automated Solutions & Detailed Guides:**  
  Provide automated solutions alongside in-depth guides, empowering users to automate instantly or build their own custom workflows with the information provided.
